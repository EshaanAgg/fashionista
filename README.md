# Fashionista

Levelling up your fashion recommendations, with the help of AI and LLMs.

## Technical Details

- The root of the project contains general-purpose scripts that can be used to data from images, and store them as JSON so that the same can be utilised by other applications and processes in the pipeline.
- The [`web`](./web/) folder contains a React application that can be used to view the extracted data. We make use of the [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/) library for component styling.
